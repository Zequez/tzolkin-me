# Tzolkin.me

Playground to explore what I can build for the Law of Time movement.

## Starter prototype

I'll be building 3 starting sections:

  - 13 Moon calendar view
  - Tzolkin view
  - Connections list to store people you have calculated their galactic signature
    and show them on the other two views

Later I'll be adding the ability to invite those people to the apps, save the connections
to the other accounts and create events that those connections can see in their network
calendars. All accounts and information will be totally public, no secrets.
